# FightClub

In this exercise I learned more about OOP in C++. The topic of the assignment was to implement a text based RPG. Each round the fighters would attack each other until only one or none is left. There are different classes of Fighters, some of them inherit properties from other classes, which makes this exercise a perfect example for OOP.
